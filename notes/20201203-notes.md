PyCharm IDE 
---------------
- I like the .md support
    - Nice preview window
   
- Scratch files
    - Nice way to keep project clean and have self notes
    
- Python Console
   - Still need to understand if there is line-by-line execution 
   - This would be familiar for us R users
    
Function Arguments
------------------
 - Use positional-only if you want the name of the parameters to not be available to the user. This is useful when parameter names have no real meaning, if you want to enforce the order of the arguments when the function is called or if you need to take some positional parameters and arbitrary keywords.

 - Use keyword-only when names have meaning and the function definition is more understandable by being explicit with names or you want to prevent users relying on the position of the argument being passed.

 - For an API, use positional-only to prevent breaking API changes if the parameterâ€™s name is modified in the future.
