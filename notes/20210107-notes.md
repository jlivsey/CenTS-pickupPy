Notes for Day 6 meeting of pickupPy group
-----------------------------------------

The overall plan is to continue learning numpy routines. 


Questions:
----------

1. How do modify a copy of an object instead of a pointer (correct term?) during assignment

	a. When assignment happens through an alegbraic operation a copy is made
	b. When do you get a copy and when a pointer?

2. Bool objects 0 = False, does any other vale = True ?

3. How do sum over both dimensions eg) np.sum(a, axis=[0,1])
