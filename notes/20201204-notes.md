Data Structures
---------------
- Lists
    - use list.count(x) to get number of times x occurs
    - use list.index(x) to get first index of x occurrence
    - use list.append(x) to put x at "end" or "top" 
    - create a stack, use list.pop() to remove "top" of stack
    - can we pop multiple items?
    - a queue removes from "bottom", but is less efficient [skip]
    - list comprehension: concise list making
- Matrix
    - construct as list comprehension
    - transpose it using a list comprehension
