## Installing packages 
(A) 'pip' is pythonâ€™s package manager. 
It has comes built-in to Python

(B) Anaconda is created by Continuum Analytics, and it is a Python distribution that comes preinstalled with lots of useful python libraries for data science.
Anaconda also introduces its own package manager, called 'conda', from where you can install libraries.
Additionally, Anaconda still has the useful interaction with pip that allows you to install any additional libraries which are not available in the Anaconda package manager.
